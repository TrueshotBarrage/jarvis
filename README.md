# Jarvis

Welcome to Jarvis, a fully automated personal assistant.

## Functionality

- Give an overview of the upcoming day: the weather, todos, events.

## Components

- Heart (server): The central coordinator. Stitches everything together into a
  single, cohesive unit.
- Armor (frontend): The pretty face. The visible, exposed parts of Jarvis.
- Mouth (voice interface): Jarvis will interpret your verbal commands and handle
  them properly through this unit.
- Brain (AI): Any complicated operations must be handled intelligently. Those go
  here.
- Arms (API): Reaches out to other components. Features the API interface for
  handling all calls to other internal components or external APIs.
